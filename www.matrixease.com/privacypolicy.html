            <p>
                It is Calypso Systems, LLC’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to
                matrixease.com (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "matrixease.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you
                may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we
                use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect
                through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our Website.
                Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
            </p>

            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
            <p>
                Like most website operators, Calypso Systems, LLC collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
                available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Calypso Systems, LLC’s purpose in
                collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Calypso Systems, LLC’s visitors use its website. From time to time,
                Calypso Systems, LLC may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Calypso Systems, LLC also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users
                leaving comments on matrixease.com blog posts. Calypso Systems, LLC only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances
                that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
            </p>

            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p>
                Certain visitors to Calypso Systems, LLC’s websites choose to interact with Calypso Systems, LLC in ways that require Calypso Systems, LLC to gather
                personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Calypso Systems, LLC gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
                For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at matrixease.com to provide a username and email address.
            </p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
                storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>

            <h2>Advertisements</h2>
            <p>

                computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad
                networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of
                cookies by Calypso Systems, LLC and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
